# Security Policy

## üîí DevSecOps Security Framework

This document outlines our comprehensive security approach using automated scanning, vulnerability management, and secure development practices.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Scanning Pipeline

### Automated Security Scans

Our CI/CD pipeline includes comprehensive security scanning using **Trivy** that runs on every push and pull request:

#### üìÅ **Filesystem Scanning**
- Scans all source code and configuration files
- Detects hardcoded secrets and credentials
- Identifies configuration vulnerabilities
- Checks for license compliance issues

#### üì¶ **Dependency Scanning**
- Analyzes `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- Identifies known vulnerabilities in npm packages
- Checks for outdated dependencies with security issues
- Validates dependency integrity

#### üê≥ **Container Image Scanning**
- Scans Docker base images for OS vulnerabilities
- Analyzes application layer security
- Checks for container misconfigurations
- Validates security best practices compliance

### Security Levels

| Severity | Action | CI Behavior |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **CRITICAL** | ‚ùå **FAIL** | Blocks deployment |
| **HIGH** | ‚ùå **FAIL** | Blocks deployment |
| **MEDIUM** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARN** | Allows deployment with warnings |
| **LOW** | ‚ÑπÔ∏è **INFO** | Informational only |

## üö® Vulnerability Response Process

### Critical/High Vulnerabilities

1. **Immediate Action Required**
   - CI/CD pipeline will fail
   - Deployment is blocked
   - Security team is automatically notified

2. **Resolution Process**
   - Update affected packages: `npm update [package]`
   - If no fix available, assess risk and document in `.trivyignore`
   - All ignores require security team approval

3. **Documentation Required**
   ```bash
   # Example .trivyignore entry
   CVE-2024-12345
   # Reason: No patch available, risk mitigated by WAF
   # Risk Level: Medium (infrastructure protected)
   # Review Date: 2024-02-15
   # Next Review: 2024-03-15
   ```

### Medium/Low Vulnerabilities

1. **Scheduled Remediation**
   - Address during next development cycle
   - Monitor for severity escalation
   - Document in security backlog

## üîß Security Configuration

### Trivy Configuration

Our security scanning is configured via `trivy.yaml`:

- **Scanners Enabled**: Vulnerabilities, Secrets, Config, Licenses
- **Severity Threshold**: HIGH and CRITICAL fail CI
- **Secret Detection**: AWS keys, GitHub tokens, JWT tokens, DB URLs
- **License Compliance**: Prohibits GPL licenses

### Ignored Vulnerabilities

All ignored vulnerabilities are documented in `.trivyignore` with:
- CVE identifier
- Justification for ignoring
- Risk assessment
- Review dates
- Mitigation measures

## üìä Security Reporting

### GitHub Security Tab

- All scan results are uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- SARIF format for detailed vulnerability information
- Automatic integration with GitHub Advanced Security

### Artifacts

Security scan artifacts are retained for 30 days:
- `trivy-fs-results.sarif` - Filesystem scan results
- `trivy-image-results.sarif` - Container scan results
- `security-report.md` - Human-readable summary

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Guidelines

### Before Committing

1. **Run Security Scan Locally**
   ```bash
   # Install Trivy locally
   brew install aquasecurity/trivy/trivy
   
   # Scan filesystem
   trivy fs . --severity HIGH,CRITICAL
   
   # Scan dependencies
   trivy fs . --scanners vuln --severity HIGH,CRITICAL
   ```

2. **Check Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Check for known vulnerabilities
   npm audit
   
   # Fix automatically fixable issues
   npm audit fix
   ```

3. **Validate Docker Images**
   ```bash
   # Build and scan your Docker image
   docker build -t myapp:latest .
   trivy image myapp:latest --severity HIGH,CRITICAL
   ```

### Dependency Management

1. **Adding New Dependencies**
   - Research security history of packages
   - Use `npm audit` before adding
   - Prefer well-maintained packages with active security

2. **Updating Dependencies**
   - Regular updates during development cycles
   - Test thoroughly after security updates
   - Monitor for breaking changes

3. **Lock File Management**
   - Always commit `package-lock.json`
   - Use `npm ci` in production/CI
   - Regenerate lock file when conflicts occur:
     ```bash
     rm package-lock.json
     npm install
     git add package-lock.json
     git commit -m "fix: sync lock file for CI compatibility"
     ```

## üöÄ CI/CD Integration

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Security Scan** (Parallel with Tests)
   - Must pass before build stage
   - Generates security reports
   - Uploads results to GitHub Security

2. **Build** (After Security + Tests Pass)
   - Builds application and Docker image
   - Additional container scanning
   - Prepares for deployment

3. **Deploy** (After Build Passes)
   - Deploys only if all security checks pass
   - Maintains security posture in production

### Workflow Optimization

```yaml
# Optimized Node.js setup
- name: Use Node.js ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
    cache: 'npm'
    cache-dependency-path: package-lock.json

- name: Clean install dependencies
  run: npm ci
```

## üîç Monitoring and Alerting

### Automated Alerts

- **Critical vulnerabilities** ‚Üí Immediate Slack/email notification
- **Failed security scans** ‚Üí Development team notification
- **New vulnerability databases** ‚Üí Weekly security review

### Regular Reviews

- **Weekly**: Review ignored vulnerabilities
- **Monthly**: Update security policies
- **Quarterly**: Security architecture review
