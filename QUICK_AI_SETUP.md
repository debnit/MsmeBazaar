## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "OpenAI API key not found"
**Solution**: Make sure your `.env` file has `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` and restart the server

### Issue: "Pinecone connection failed" 
**Solution**: Check your `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT` matches your dashboard (e.g., `us-east1-gcp`)

### Issue: "Vector search disabled"
**Solution**: This is normal without API keys. Add keys to enable full functionality.

### Issue: "Index not found"
**Solution**: Create the index in Pinecone dashboard:
1. Go to Pinecone dashboard
2. Create new index: `msmebazaar-vectors`
3. Dimensions: `1536`
4. Metric: `cosine`

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys to git**
2. **Use different keys for dev/prod**
3. **Set up billing alerts in OpenAI**
4. **Monitor usage regularly**
5. **Rotate keys periodically**

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check logs**: `npm start` and look for error messages
2. **Test configuration**: `npm run test:ai`
3. **Verify keys**: Make sure they're not placeholder values
4. **Check environment**: Ensure `.env` file is in project root
5. **Restart server**: After changing `.env`, always restart
